Introducion:

Calories burnt Prediction model is a broad idea of predicting calories based on a person's gender,
age,height,weight,duration of exercise,heart-rate and body temperature.
The practial application of our model is specified in the name itself, widely useful for calorie tracking
by fitness enthusiasts.
With increasing disease spread and obesity problems our model is the simplest,most efficient way to
monitor health and weight of an individual.
It takes as input a person's gender,age,height,weight,duration of exercise,heart-rate and body temperature 
and based on this input the model predicts the person's calories burnt.
We have done this model using XGB Regressor and python language.Python has many built in modules to 
implement data processing and visualisation
